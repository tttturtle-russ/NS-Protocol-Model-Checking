Bit statespace search for:
	never claim         	- (not selected)
	assertion violations	+
	cycle checks       	- (disabled by -DSAFETY)
	invalid end states	- (disabled by -E flag)

State-vector 88 byte, depth reached 27, errors: 0
       15 states, stored
        0 states, matched
       15 transitions (= stored+matched)
       10 atomic steps

hash factor: 8.94785e+06 (best if > 100.)

bits set per state: 3 (-k3)

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    0.002	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
   16.000	memory used for hash array (-w27)
    0.305	memory used for bit stack
    2.136	memory used for DFS stack (-m40000)
   18.918	total actual memory usage
